"""
You're given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)]. You must compute a list output[0..(n-1)] such that, for each index i (between 0 and n-1, inclusive), output[i] is equal to the product of the three largest elements out of arr[0..i] (or equal to -1 if i < 2, as arr[0..i] then includes fewer than three elements).
Note that the three largest elements used to form any product may have the same values as one another, but they must be at different indices in arr.
Signature
int[] findMaxProduct(int[] arr)
Input
n is in the range [1, 100,000].
Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, 1,000].
Output
Return a list of n integers output[0..(n-1)], as described above.
Example 1
n = 5
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
output = [-1, -1, 6, 24, 60]
The 3rd element of output is 3*2*1 = 6, the 4th is 4*3*2 = 24, and the 5th is 5*4*3 = 60.
Example 2
n = 5
arr = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
output = [-1, -1, 4, 4, 8]
The 3rd element of output is 2*2*1 = 4, the 4th is 2*2*1 = 4, and the 5th is 2*2*2 = 8.

"""
The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
Implement the MedianFinder class:

MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
 

Constraints:

-105 <= num <= 105
There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.
At most 5 * 104 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian.
