Tell me about working with others in the organization

    Project: retail-to-onchain layer - DEX
    - Required to build workflows in Cadence, a workflow orchestration system
    - Met with tech leads on their team to understand capabilities and design rational
    - How to best integrate and accelerate technical adoption
    - Cultivated a relationship between our teams
    - Technical checkpoint for new features
    - Discussed version 2.0 of their service with higher level primitives
    - Contributed to their technical direction and home away model to migrate some of our workflows

Going above and beyond job responsibilities

    Project: retail-to-onchain layer - DEX
    - Discovered exploit in our platform
    - Proactive monitoring and alerting in place
    - Immediate action to kills witch and place hold onto the user's account
    - 10-12 hours to triage, replicate, and re-architect critical pathwards
    - slowly ramp up afterwards
    - Created document outlining what happened and what plans we are taking to hedge against future
    - Presented to directors and technical leads the next week
    - Full ownership

Disagreements with management

    Project: dapp wallet
    - Leadership decided to deprecate this feature of the application due to complexity and product overlap
    - Decision to completely remove the browser aspect and require users to overboard their funds
    - Agree with removing the browser, I believed there's a lot of latent potential
    - Technical design to abstract away the browser features and put them behind first party integrations
    - Offer controlled surfaces and features for lending, staking, etc
    - Got bye-in from product folks and management and alignment with leadership

New technologies to complete a project

    Project: Kubernetes Migration
    - Few engineers in the org with K8s experience
    - Acted as DRI for our orgs migration
    - Set up Migration and monitoring guidance for k8s clusters
    - Weekly syncs with DRIs from teams across the org to track progress
    - Set up backend round table to up-level the team and suggested other teams do the same.

Describe a situation where you had to manage conflicting priorities. How did you determine what was most important, and what was the result?

    Project: Home-away model with transfers team for version 2.0 of workflow orchestration
    - MVP is important long-term but doesn't move our OKRs or drive direct revenue
    - Able to communicate and load balance with this team to decrease rate of contribution
    - Provided clear path forward to accomplish immediate and long term goals

Technical challenge? problem?  How did I overcome it?  What was the approach?  The results?

    Project: Analysis ready data platform
    - I identified a lot of complexity and room for improvement in the workflow of our analysts
    - Instead of a SWE hat we can abstract away a ton of complexity and provide much better latencies and more reliability
    - Near-real time stream based image classification
    - Scalable system that was flexible enough to handle different modalities (SAR, vision, etc.) while hedging against data and job loss.
    - High throughput in-memory matching service reading from kafka with replication to hedge against failures
    - Series of queues with retries and re-drive potential in the event of failures

Advocate for change or technology within a team?

    Project: Defi Wallet
    - Building asynchronous data consumers as side processes within the application layer
    - scaling consumers based upon API driven application, no compartmentalization or least privileged access
    - Created a technical document to decompose these services
    - Provided a Backend Round Table session to talk about Asynchronous Technologies
    - Led to a more clear technical vision of our services and more dynamically scalable and better performant services

What is some feedback you have received from peers / managers that made you a better engineer?

    Project: Retail Dex
    - We were one of the only teams at Coinbase to bridge the gap between retail-to-onchain workflows
    - A lot of excitement and visibility internally for this project so a lot of teams wanted to work with us.
    - I was the driving force behind a lot of cross organizational collaboration and integration
    - Reviewing their technical documentation, providing clarity and support for integration, guidance, etc.
    - Received feedback around task delegation
    - These types of engagements provide a lot of visibility and it's a good area for growth for other members of the team
    - It also frees me up to do more scoping work for new features
    - Helps me become a better engineer and look for areas of growth for other engineers on the team

What is your approach to managing deadlines and working under pressure within an engineering environment?

    Project: Lending contracts with their retail balance
    - Communication when managing deadlines is key.  If you're reaching or missing a deadline
    - Always best to over communicate than under and suprise people
    - High visibility project to provide an abstracted first party view of defi lending within retail application
    - Due to unknown unknowns we weren't going to make our deadlines ( the smart contract wasn't working correctly
    and out team didn't have expertise in fixing it ).
    - Openly communicating these blockers allowed others on the team and management to provide cross organizational
    support to get this done and meet our deadlines

Explain a time when you had to adapt your communication style to convey complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

    Project: Retail Dex
    - at coinbase any changes touching funds requires interfacing with Finance, Legal, Compliance
    - Architecture for our service for on chain quoting and execution from retail
    - Transform this architecture into something digestible
    - Dont care about APIs but care deeply about their expertise
    - ID what they care about and deliver pertinent details.
