Questions they may ask:

    Why do you want to work for Anduril?

    Well, I really like the work that Anduril is doing and I believe in it's primary mission.  Previously, I was in the defense
    and intelligence space while I was at Maxar and I thought that work has been the most impactful out of anything I've done
    previously and I really want to get back in that direction.  Impactful, technically challenging work.

Questions I have:

    Can you tell me more about the Mission Engineering Team or the position in general?
        mission autonomy -> lattice customization, unmanned aircraft control integration
        c&c team all-domain view, lattice data mesh, target, tracking - hardware product
        lattice related - lattice for  c&c
            big priority - integrated with other systems
            menace c2 offering - hardened terminal hub prototype phase
            application layer / ui
            data layer / data ingestion / tracked through lattice

    Can you tell me more about the compensation for this position?

        cash + RSU = total compensation == L5 - 215 (375/4=93.75) = 308.75 | L6 - 245 (840/4=210) = 455

    What's interviewing like for a staff software engineer at Anduril?
        tech interview, phone interview, zoom call - leetcode style
        1 coding round, system, behavioral
        clear first round, team matching

    More questions:
        Can you tell me more about Mission Engineering Teams?  The structure?  How do they operate or live within the
        org as the more traditional engineering role?

        How did you get to Anduril?  How would you describe the engineering culture here compared to other roles
        you might've had?

        Clearance process?  Are there interim projects as this takes place -- assuming what i'm doing will change
        once i'm read into a project.


Cleared the first round!

Next steps are the in person interview.
