A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.



Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: s = "1+(2*3)/(2-1)"
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: s = "1"

"""
A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.

For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.
A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
Example 2:

At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings ops, where ops[i] is 
the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following: 

An integer x - Record a new score of x. "+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is 
guaranteed there will always be two previous scores. "D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It 
is guaranteed there will always be a previous score. "C" - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the 
record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score. Return the sum of all the scores on the record. 

 

Example 1:

Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].

Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.

A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters s[i] and s[i + 1] where:

0 <= i <= s.length - 2 s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa. 
To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. You can 
keep doing this until the string becomes good. 

Return the string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints.

Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.
The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.
Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

A node is a leaf if and only if it has zero children.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation: There are two possible trees shown.
The first has a non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

"""Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for 
the current day. 

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and 
going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price. 

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100,80,60,70,60,75,85], then the stock spans would be [1,1,1,2,1,4,6].
Implement the StockSpanner class:

StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.

"""Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next 
greater number for every element in nums. 

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, 
which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this 
number.

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;

"""
On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.

Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a 
function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current 
function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or 
ended, and the timestamp. 

You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string "{function_id}:{"start" 
| "end"}:{timestamp}". For example, "0:start:3" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of 
timestamp 3, and "1:end:2" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a 
function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively. 

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, 
if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, 
the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3. 

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive 
time for the function with ID i. 



Example 1:


Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.
Example 3:

Input: n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.
