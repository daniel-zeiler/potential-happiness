"""
Perform a bidirectional BFS on a graph from source to target.

Parameters
----------
graph : dict
    A dictionary representing a graph, where the keys are nodes and the values
    are a list of adjacent nodes.
source : object
    The source node of the BFS.
target : object
    The target node of the BFS.

Returns
-------
visited : set
    A set of visited nodes during the BFS.

Raises
------
ValueError
    If the source or target node is not in the graph.

This function implements a binary search algorithm to search for an element in a sorted list.

Parameters:
input_list (list): The sorted list to search in.
target (object): The element to search for.

Returns:
int: The index of the target element in the input list, or -1 if the target element is not found.

This function implements the merge sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.

Parameters:
nums (list): The list of numbers to be sorted.

Returns:
list: The sorted list of numbers.

This function implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph.

Parameters: graph (dict): A dictionary representing a weighted undirected graph, where the keys are nodes and the 
values are a list of tuples representing edges. Each tuple consists of two nodes and a weight.

Returns:
list: A list of edges that form the minimum spanning tree. Each edge is represented as a tuple consisting of two nodes.
