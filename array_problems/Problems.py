A city's skyline is the the outer contour formed by all the building when viewing the side of the

be different.

We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings by any amount (the amount can be

Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!

You are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:

'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, 
right, and all 4 diagonals),
digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
'X' represents a revealed mine.
You are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next 
click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').

Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' 
and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (
'1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
 

Example 1:


Input: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E",
"E","E"]], click = [3,0]

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash 
them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of 
this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular 
automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (
represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (
horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia 
article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current 
state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid 
board, return the next state.

 

Example 1:


Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
Example 2:


Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 

Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You 
cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, 
which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., 
live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

complexity.

"""
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. 
The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have 
the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements 
after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It 
does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array 
in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 
0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example:

"hello" -> "heeellooo"
"hi" -> "hiiii"
In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: "h", 
"eee", "ll", "ooo".

You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can 
be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: 
choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so 
that the size of the group is three or more.

For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", 
but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has a size less than three. Also, we could do 
another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo". If s = "helllllooo", then the query 
word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" -> 
"hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = s.
Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "heeellooo", words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.
