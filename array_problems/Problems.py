"""
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.



Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

"""
Find the largest perimeter of an island given a 2 dimensional array of 1's and 0's representing land and water respectively.

Land = 1
Water = 0
Island = contiguous 1's that are adjacent to other 1's to the left, right, up, or down

Edge of an island = any 1 that is adjacent to a 0 OR grid boundary to the left, right, up, or down

Perimeter = total # of 1's on the edge of an island

Example 1:

Input:
[[1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]]

Output: 7 (Island on the right)
Example 2:

Input:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

Output: 9 (Island on the right)
