    Analysis Ready Data Platform
        Serverless application backed by a custom data store.
        Earth divided into successive quadtrees.  Each node containing metadata about that region
        This allowed our analysts and ML engineers to share a common interface to better serve our
        end users.

    Automated ML Infrastructure Deployment for continuous delivery
        We also created a way for analysts to automate the deployment of machine learning infrastructure
        on top of our analysis ready data platform.  This allowed for the continous delivery of data
        products to our end-users, significantly cut down on developer overhead, and standardized
        practices with which we created and delivered our products.

        For example, an analyst would delineate a bounding box within the ARD platform and designate
        which models to execute and we would take care of the rest so everytime new imagery arrives
        within this region, infra will be in place to batch-process and classify the imagery.

    DARPA contract
        I also worked on a Darpa (or Defense Advanced Research Project Association) project. This
        was essentially a way for our users to have a common interface for a number of different
        models and data sources.
