Customer Obsession: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders
pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

    Example 1: Who was your most difficult customer?
        Situation: Customer wasn't familiar with how APIs work and they were based in Japan / not fluent in English
        Task: I needed to get them using our API.  They were unable to develop a solution that enabled them to stream us
        data and handle responses appropriately.
        Action: I Built a python SDK package for them that was then used by others.  This was generalized and a standard
        offering for the company going forward.
        Learning:  It taught me a lot about expectations of the customer and how to optimize for smooth onboarding and 
        ease of use.

    Example 2: Tell me about a time when you didn't meet customer expectations.  What happened and how did you deal with 
    the situation.
        Situation:  A frontend feature was rolled out without adequate testing and this caused recurring errors on that 
        part of the application.  This

    Example 3:  How do you go about prioritizing customer needs when you are dealing with a large number of customers?
        Situation:
        Task:
        Action:
        Result:

Ownership: Leaders are owners. They think long-term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire
company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

    Example 1:Tell me about a time when you took on a task that was beyond your job responsibilities
        Situation:
        Task:
        Action:
        Result:
    
    Example 2: Tell me about a time when you had to work on a task with unclear responsibilities
        Situation:
        Task:
        Action:
        Result:
        
    Example 3: Tell me about a time when you showed an intitive to work on a challenging project.
        Situation:
        Task:
        Action:
        Result:

Invent and Simplify: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally
aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be
misunderstood for long periods of time.

    Example 1:Describe a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem

    Example 2: Tell me about a time when you invented something.

    Example 3: Tell me about a time when you tried to simplify a process but failed.  What would you have done differently.


Learn and Be Curious: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to
explore them.
    Example 1:


    Example 2:



Dive Deep: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task
is beneath them.
    Example 1:


    Example 2:


Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is
uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is
determined, they commit wholly.
    Example 1:


    Example 2:


Deliver Results: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks,
they rise to the occasion and never settle.
    Example 1:


    Example 2:


interviewer 1: logical maintainable
    learn and be curios, invent and simplify

interviewer 2: coding data structures algorithms
    ownership, customer obsession

interviewer 3: system design
    have backbone disagree and commit, and earns trust

interviewer 4: coding problem solving
    deliver results, dive deep
