Projects - Come up with 5-7 projects from your current role or past companies (A project is defined as things you’ve done professionally. For example, a software feature you launched, changing the way code reviews are done, writing a wiki for some product, etc. A project is any event you’ve done professionally)
Write Out the Projects- Write/type these projects on a Word Doc or a piece of paper
Write a Summary – With the list of projects you now have, write a summary for each project. Use this 4-step template below to write your summaries:
Provide context – Providing context about the narrative before you get into the essential part of the story (Situation)
What was the problem – What was the thing that needed to be done? (Task)
What did you do – What was the action or how did you solve that problem? (Action)
What were the results? (Results)

    System to train and deploy machine learning models

        Situation
            Our AI startup needed a way for our customers to train machine learning models on their given datasets.
            They also needed to compare different results across training methods, and deploy different versions into
            production as needed.
        Task
            As the first backend engineer I needed to design a system that was scalable enough to handle a rapidly
            increasing workload.
        Action

        Result
            This allowed us to build a MVP that would allow customers to train and deploy their own models using our
            infrastructure.

    Python SDK to integrate with our API

        Situation
            When I worked at Reality Analytics one of our first customers were a lab in Japan trying to use our API.
            They weren't really familiar with using APIs and it was challenging to go back and forth with them
            trying to integrate their workflow with ours due to the time difference.
        Task
            I needed to streamline this process and generalize for all future customers.  Our product was easy to use
            from our perspective but it was apparent that it was difficult to use from others perspective.
        Action
            I put together a Python SDK that handled credentials, querying our API for results, streaming data into
            our systems, training, validating, and deploying models, etc.  I then alongside my team were able to
            merge this into the documentation and presented it to our friends in Japan.
        Result
            This became the go-to method for onboarding new users and drastically decreased the engineering overhead
            we would need to take up with new customers.
