I'm currently a senior software engineer at Coinbase. I'm part of the Retail Web3 team.  We're sort of like a startup
within Coinbase.  We build applications that bring the broader web3 ecosystem into the retail application.

Previously I was a senior software engineer at Twitter.  I was part of the Data Platform and Apps team.  There I built
a number of data ingestion and processing applications for large volumes of incoming data like clicks and impressions. I also
built and mantained Looker internally at Twitter

Previously I was a Staff Software Engineer at Maxar Technologies, a geospatial imagery and satellite company.  I worked
on a few projects including the Analysis Ready Data platform, which allowed analysts and internal customers to leverage
deployed ML models and an incoming stream of satellite imagery to build analytics.  I also worked with DARPA on the
Geospatial Cloud Analytics Hub which combined multi-source and multi-model image processing into a single cloud based
application.

And finally I was one of the first employees at an AI startup called Reality AI.  We primarily targeted the wearables,
industrial, and IoT spaces. They were recently acquired which I'm super happy about.
