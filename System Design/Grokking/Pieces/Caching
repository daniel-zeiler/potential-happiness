Caches take care of locality of reference principle

A cache is short-term memory.  Much faster than reading from disk or
the database.

CDN (Conent Delivery Network)

Typically caches static assets like images, jpegs, video, html, etc.
If not available the cache will query the backend server for the files

Cache invalidation:
    Write-through cache
        increases latency, both are written at the same time.
        Minimizes risk of data loss.

    Write-around cache
        write goes directly to database bypassing cache. Making the cache
        invalid.  Newer reads will be slower.

    Write-back cache
        Writes go directly to the cache.  Fastest way.  Cache then handles
        database writes.  Low latency, high throughput.  Risk of data loss
