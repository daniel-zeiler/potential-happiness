Load balancers do a number of things
    distribute load across multiple copies of a service
    keep track of health of resources
    stop sending traffic to elevated error rate resource


    Client -> LB -> Web Server -> LB -> Application -> LB -> database

Benfits of load balancing
    Faster uninterrupted service
    less downtime and higher throughput
    requests are distributed across a cluster

Load balancing algorithms:
    Least Connection method
    Least response time method
    Least bandwidth method
    Round robin Method
    Weighted round robin method
